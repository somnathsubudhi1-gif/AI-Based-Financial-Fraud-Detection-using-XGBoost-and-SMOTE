Course: AI - Week 17 Final Assignment  



  Project Title and Description

This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based system to detect financial fraud in online transactions. The core objective is to improve fraud recall and reduce false negatives by using class-balancing techniques and advanced classifiers like XGBoost and LightGBM. The model is based on the original code by Arunava Kumar Chakraborty and is significantly enhanced through multiple upgrades.

 Environment Setup and Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Libraries:
  bash
  pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm imbalanced-learn matplotlib seaborn streamlit joblib
  



 Instructions to Reproduce Results

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Ensure you have `Fraud.csv` dataset in your working directory.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script for training and evaluation.
4. The trained XGBoost model will be saved as `xgb_model.pkl`.

Steps to Train Your Own Model

1. Data Preprocessing
   - Handled missing values and outliers.
   - Addressed multicollinearity.

2. Feature Engineering
   - Created new features: `balanceDiffPercent`, `isNightTransaction`, `transactionCount`

3. Class Balancing
   - Applied SMOTE to resolve data imbalance.

4. Model Training  
   - Trained XGBoost and LightGBM classifiers.

5. Evaluation  
   - Used classification report and confusion matrix.

 Results Summary

 Logistic Regression (Before Upgrade)
- Fraud Recall: 0.37
- F1-score (Fraud): 0.51
- Accuracy: ~100% (due to imbalance)

 XGBoost (After Upgrade)

               precision    recall  f1-score   support

 Not Fraud       1.00      0.91      0.95   1270871

Macro avg        0.51      0.90      0.49   1272521
Weighted avg     1.00      0.91      0.95   1272521

>  Fraud recall improved significantly after applying SMOTE and advanced models.



 Notes or Limitations

- Precision for fraud class is low due to aggressive fraud flagging.
- More features and time-based patterns can improve results further.
